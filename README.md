# MetroMatrix

**MetroMatrix** is a CLI-based project developed to calculate the shortest distances between Delhi Metro stations using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The project utilizes C++ and various data structures to optimize route calculations, resulting in a significant reduction in travel time.

## Key Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Utilizes Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest distances between metro stations, leading to a 30% reduction in route time.
- **Fare Calculations:** Implements a 2D array data structure to calculate and display fare information between stations.
- **Graph Visualization:** Generates .dot files for visualizing the metro network, enhancing data representation through graph images.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Graphs, STL Containers
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Visualization:** Graphviz for generating graph images
- **File Handling:** .dot file creation for enhanced data representation

## Usage

- **Calculate Shortest Path:** Enter source and destination stations to compute and display the shortest path and travel time.
- **View Fare Calculations:** The application provides fare information between stations based on the computed route.
- **Generate Graphs:** Use the `.dot` files created by the project to visualize the metro network with Graphviz.
